Memeorandum Colors
==================

Browser add-on to visualize linking bias on political websites.

Installation
------------

Memeorandum Colors is a Greasemonkey user-script, which works 
natively in Google Chrome or with the Greasemonkey plugin for
Firefox.

When installed, it will color links on Memeorandum based on
each site's historical linking activity.  The brighter the
color, the more they link only to articles in their same
group.
