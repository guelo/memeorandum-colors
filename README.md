Memeorandum Colors
==================

Browser add-on to visualize linking bias on political websites.

Installation
------------

Memeorandum Colors is a Greasemonkey user-script, which works 
natively in Google Chrome or with the Greasemonkey plugin for
Firefox.

each site's historical linking activity.  The brighter the
color, the more they link only to articles in their same
group.

2. Visit Memeorandum and wait a moment for the links to color.
